# PDF Q&A Web App (Portfolio Project)

## 🚀 Project Kickoff

Hi! I'm starting a new portfolio project to strengthen my AI engineering skills and showcase my work for internship opportunities.

This project is a **PDF Q&A Web App** where users can upload PDFs and ask questions about their content. The system uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to provide accurate answers from the uploaded documents. My focus is on building a clean, modular AI pipeline and a professional structure that demonstrates real-world engineering skills.

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Build a **polished MVP** that highlights AI engineering and full-stack skills.
- Showcase my ability to handle **PDF processing, embeddings, semantic search, and AI-powered Q&A**.
- Present a project that is **understandable, documented, and professional**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend:** FastAPI  
**Database:** PostgreSQL (users, PDFs, metadata)  
**Vector DB:** Qdrant (for embeddings and semantic search)  
**Frontend:** React + Tailwind (minimal MVP)  
**Authentication:** Email + Password + JWT  
**LLM Provider:** Flexible (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

> **Notice:** Since most of the tech I’m using here (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Qdrant) is **new to me**, this project is as much about learning as it is about building.

---

## 📋 MVP Features

- **User Management:** Sign up, login, JWT-protected endpoints, rate limiting
- **PDF Upload:** Upload PDFs, extract text, and process content
- **AI Q&A:** Chunk text, generate embeddings, perform semantic retrieval, and answer questions using LLM
- **Frontend MVP:** Login/Register, Dashboard, PDF Upload, and Q&A Chat interface

> This is the minimal set of features to demonstrate the core AI engineering skills while keeping the project manageable.

## 🗂️ Project Structure (Planned)

- `backend/` → FastAPI backend, authentication, PDF processing, embeddings, Qdrant integration
- `frontend/` → React + Tailwind UI for MVP screens
- `docs/` → project documentation, reusable prompts, notes, and roadmap

---

## 📅 Timeline

I plan to work on this project over the next **60 days** (starting from 10 Dec.), focusing on:

1. Backend skeleton + user management
2. PDF extraction and processing
3. Embeddings + RAG pipeline
4. Frontend MVP pages
5. Integration and testing
6. Deployment and final polishing

## 💡 Notes

This repository is intended to document the project from kickoff to completion.  
All updates, commits, and progress will be visible here to show a transparent development process.
